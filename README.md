 This is a feature diagram for the command-line tool lrzip3 using FeatureIDE. Included all crosstree constraints in addition to the feature diagram.

Cereated a feature diagram for the command-line tool lrzip3 using FeatureIDE. Included all crosstree constraints in addition to the feature diagram. This was the model of the diagram after the man–page of the tool. I didn't have to execute the tool, as I don’t take constraints that are not in the man-page into consideration. 
Ignored the Synopsis section of the man page. Only considered lrzip and not its aliases such as lrzcat.
